# CNN-Powered-Autonomous-Car

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on the implementation and testing of various Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for tasks related to autonomous driving.
I have used the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator and performed Behavioral Cloning.

**Key Features:**
Customizable Architectures: Experiment with different DNN and CNN architectures to find the most effective model for self-driving tasks.

**Data Collection:**
Develop methods for collecting and preprocessing data, crucial for training robust models.

**Simulation Testing:**
Evaluate the performance of your models in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator across various scenarios.
